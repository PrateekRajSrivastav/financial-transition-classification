Problem Statement
Financial transaction records often lack specific categorizations, making it difficult for individuals or organizations to gain insights into their spending patterns. Manual classification is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project provides an automated solution by utilizing machine learning models to classify transactions based on features like transaction description, amount, or vendor.
