Problem Statement
Financial transaction records often lack specific categorizations, making it difficult for individuals or organizations to gain insights into their spending patterns. Manual classification is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project provides an automated solution by utilizing machine learning models to classify transactions based on features like transaction description, amount, or vendor.

Features:

1.Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Cleaning and tokenizing transaction descriptions.
Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF, Count Vectorization, or Embeddings.

2.Machine Learning Models:
Trained classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Fine-tuned to maximize accuracy and minimize false predictions.

3.Evaluation Metrics:
Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for robust evaluation.

4.Interactive Demo:
Test the model with sample transaction data in the Colab notebook.
